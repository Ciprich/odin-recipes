    <h2>An easy to make, authentic Japanese dish.</h2>
        <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of a dashi stock into which 
            softened miso paste is mixed. In addition, there are many optional ingredients 
            that may be added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal 
            preference.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Finely Grated Fresh Ginger</li>

        <li>1/2 Cup Enoki Mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 Ounces Refrigerated Fresh Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>3 Cups Water</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Miso Paste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack eggs into a nonstick skiller over medium heat. Cook until outer edges
            become opaque, about 1 minute. Turn once; cook until whites are completely set,
            about 3 minutes; set eggs aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir ginger, garlic,
            leek, cabbage, and mushrooms until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in miso paste; 
            gradually whisk in water and bring to a boil. Add in ramen noodles; reduce heat
            and simmer until noodles soften, about 3 minutes. Season with soy sauce. Divide 
            into two bowls; top each serving with egg. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.

    <h2>A creamy, easy to make soup.</h2>
    <p>Cream of mushroom soup is a simple type of soup where a basic roux is thinned 
        with cream or milk and then mushrooms and/or mushroom broth are added. It is 
        well known in North America as a common type of condensed canned soup. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) Packages Fresh Sliced Mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 Pinch Salt</li>
        <li>1 Medium Yellow Onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoon All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>6 Sprigs Fresh Thyme</li>
        <li>2 Cloves Garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 Cups Chicken Broth, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 Cup Water</li>
        <li>1 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and
             1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 
             5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, 
             stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 
             15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, 
             if desired.</li>
        <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the 
            raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 
            1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme 
            bundle.</li>
        <li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt 
            and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
